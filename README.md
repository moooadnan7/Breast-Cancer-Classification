# **Breast Cancer Classification Using Neural Networks**

## **📌 Project Overview**
This project implements a **deep learning model** using a **fully connected neural network (FNN)** to classify breast cancer tumors as **benign** or **malignant** based on dataset features. The dataset is preprocessed, normalized, and used to train a model for automated cancer detection.

## **🚀 Features**
✅ **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
✅ **Binary Classification**: Predicts whether a tumor is benign or malignant.  
✅ **Data Preprocessing**: Uses `MinMaxScaler` for feature normalization.  
✅ **Model Architecture**: A fully connected neural network built with Keras and TensorFlow.  
✅ **Evaluation Metrics**: Assesses performance using accuracy and loss functions.  

## **🛠️ Technologies Used**
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Matplotlib  

## **📊 Dataset**
The dataset used contains **diagnosis labels (`benign` or `malignant`)** along with various **medical features**. It is split into **training and testing sets** using `train_test_split()` for model evaluation.
